This mod aims to provide compatibility between Player Shops by TalonsOfStealth and the total conversion mod TerraFirmaCraft (TFC) by the TFC Dev Team, by adding Player Shop blocks for the TFC wood types. As an addon, it requires both Player Shops and TFC to work.


Their respective repositories can be found at:
https://github.com/TalonsOfStealth/player-shops
https://github.com/TerraFirmaCraft/TerraFirmaCraft

Please keep in mind that I do not have much experience with programming mods
